But after that, they completely stretched out. I am constantly pulling them up when I wear them. They also pilled terribly in the crotch area. I guess that can be expected, but I would think that for the cost, they would have held up better and longer than they did. Also, the stitching on the front left side is starting to unravel. It looks like Velcro or something was stuck to it and started to unravel it, but I wash all of my Lulu with only other workout gear and there is never anything that would snag or cause this to happen.
