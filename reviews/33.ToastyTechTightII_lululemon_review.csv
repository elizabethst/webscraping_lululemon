So good, in fact, I haven't bothered to purchase any other iterations of this tight because they simply can't live up. The original Toasty Techs are made out of super stretchy, butter soft fabric and the fit is snug, but not too tight so as to be too constrictive (not good in cold weather). The Toasty Tech II on the other hand is made out of a fabric that is far less stretchy and not nearly as soft. Also the fit and construction are very sub-par. The overall fit is too tight (I'm 5'2"", 110) - my usual size 2 is difficult to get on, partially because the seams are bulky and WAY too tight. Also the quilting on leg is different - the original pockets sit flush with your leg - these puff out where the stitching is quilted - not a cute look on your thighs!

I purchased them to replace some cold-weather leggings I bought a few years back. I will say, the thickness is nice, but there were too many other flaws for me to love these. 1) The fit. The waist is loose and even when toggled, it rides down. 2) The cut. The pockets' zippers are lined with reflective design and the zipper + reflective stuff makes for a puckered zipper area when zipped. In addition, the quilted design does not have stretch to the thread, so the first time I wore these, I squatted down and the threads ripped on the quilted area. 3) The design. The quilted area is on the part of the outer thigh that can have cellulite, so it's not exactly the right spot to add texture to. Beware of a dimpled look. -- All around, I'm super disappointed.

As I am very dedicated to my lulus and still will wear them all through the winter, I thought I would finally give a lined pair a try, but I had to stop myself when I went into the store and they rang up as 190$, I couldn't get myself to spend 190$ on a pair of pants that would be 5x the quality if I got them a few years ago (not to mention cheaper).
I ended up being surprised with the same pair for Christmas because everyone knows my struggle with the cold but also loving my lulus.
One week into wearing them, a lot of the little seams on the outer thighs where the detailing is has come out, and just looks really bad to wear, like my pants are falling apart, which makes me feel really bad for the person who put so much thought into the gift as I always rave on about how great the quality of my lulu is and how I would never wear anything else.

Additionally, although I really loved the cut of the high waist, I found the elastic throughout the legs much looser than my other Lululemon bottoms, so my legs really didn't feel ""hugged"" (despite the fact that I have very large thigh and calve muscles from years of swimming and running). Because they were ""final sale"" and I couldn't return them, I figured I would just wear them as regular leggings in cooler weather but, sadly, because the fabric was thinner than anticipated, I also don't find them very flattering in the butt and thigh area.

I’m 5’3”, 123 lbs. I tried these on in store in the burgundy color before Christmas in a 4 and a 6, I couldn’t get the 4 over my thighs so I went with the 6, got them hemmed, and have run in them a few times and enjoyed them. The waist on the 6 is a bit big, but the fleece seems to keep them from falling down. The pockets are good - the zipper pocket is just big enough to fit my iPhone X with the case on. I like the quilting detail, but it does seem to make the tights less stretchy in that area. And they achieve the desired goal of keeping my legs warm on runs below 20* F.

The beautiful quilted seams on the sides are not at all stretchy and seem to not be well made. I didn't have any issues putting the pants on, the seams were intact prior to leaving the house but somewhere along the way on our walk the seams split on 2 separate lines. That was the first pair. I went in and exchanged them no problem because it had only been 2 days since I bought them. I've now had the new pair for around a month and only just wore this pair to find that on my drive home after wearing them out grocery shopping that a seam has come unravelled on this one too. These are $150 and I would have thought they'd be a bit more practical. I got my regular size and they fit fine. My legs are not bulging out of them and if anything the waist could fit tighter. I enjoy running outside in the winter, hiking, and snowshoeing and I bought these knowing they're thicker than any of my other lulu leggings and thought they would hold up nicely for evening walks with my dog.

I did have to turn them inside out and snip some small plastic bits at the end of the zipper that had been left (they poked me in the leg) but it was an easy fix.

I run and lift for exercise, and take a weekly exercise class, and I find myself not overly-hot in these tights indoors.

In the struggle to put them on, several of the threads that create the quilting pattern on the outer thigh snapped and are now just hanging off the tights.

It's like one of those slip-knot style stitches that unravels in the blink of an eye as soon as there's an opportunity.
You can see that the quilted pattern is coming completely undone, and these will look like a puffy saddle bag on each side of your thigh. I've only washed them once by now, but it's clear they are NOT going to last, and what's worse is that by the time they unravel completely, they'll be extremely unflattering with unnecessary padding in the outer thigh area. So disappointing.
A secondary disappointment was the useless size of the pockets. Can't fit a phone or much of anything aside from a card or gel. I'm so mad I bought these at full price as my present to myself.

There is cross stitching on the tights and you do need to be a little careful with it as to make sure that you don't tear the thread. As long as you get a size that fits and you don't rush to pull them on, they will last fine.
Overall, I would order another pair even if the stitching needs a little work because for 89, I honestly think it's a steal.",4 out of 5,IDAHOBORN,"IDAHO, US",RUNNER,25-34,CURVY,snug,pockets,thread,2019-01-16,2,0,{}

Just by trying on the stitching came loose on the quilted part immediately. I mentioned this to the associate and she said they were aware of the problem and had notified the appropriate people. My question is why would you sell something that you knew was defected. Very disappointed that Lululemon would allow this. It only makes for unhappy customers.

I find they are superior to most brands and last longer. Unfortunately, the best way for me to describe the Toasty Tech Tight II is trash.
The fabric is thin and the fleece is barely there. This is NOT a legging that will keep you warm running in the winter. I’m 5’4 and 125lbs with an athletic body type and have never had a problem before with size 4. That wasn’t the case with these leggings. First of all, the Toasty Tech Tight II was designed with someone who is 5’10 in mind. You can’t even short and wear them without having them hemmed. The leggings were a good three inches too long and hard to put on.
The quilt design below the zipper is also low quality besides the fabric itself. As I tried the leggings on the stitching popped. This is something I would expect after wearing the legging 100 times, not the first time.
Altogether I feel that the quality for this leggings is what you’d expect in a $20 pair of leggings, not a $138 pair. I would strongly advise anyone looking to purchase these leggings to buy a different style or look elsewhere for fleece leggings.
I would like to point out It’s potential I received a faulty pair. However, judging from other reviews, this is just a badly designed pair of Lululemon leggings.

I couldn't even imagine trying to run in them. They'd be down around my knees. For the record I bought a size 8 which is my regular size Lulu legging. I tried the 6 on, but as other reviewers have stated, the quilting on the leg was way too tight. So sizing down wasn't an option. I don't think it would have mattered anyway. The fabric just does not hold up. There is no compression. Very poorly made. Disappointing because cold weather leggings are hard to find.

I needed some winter running pants that I could trust, and these are just what I needed! The padding on the outer thighs made a big difference in keeping my legs warm, and the fabric keeps the heat inside. These do pill easily which is mildly disappointing for the price but I'll take some minor thigh pilling over literally freezing my butt off. What is also great is that the fabric also manages to keep wind out, keeps sweat/moisture off of my body, and the high waist helps keep my core warm. I took a chance on these since the educators at my local store were not familiar with winter running, and it was worth it. These are a cold weather must have.

2. It didn't pill - not the fabric itself but the seams. This is worries me that it'll eventually start to fray. I wash these in as per instructions and in a lingerie bag to be extra careful.

At first when I pulled them on, I was afraid I'd made a mistake because they were TIGHT (I have decently muscular legs from weight lifting and running) but sure enough, they stretched a bit to allow a more comfortable fit. I wore these tights twice before washing, only on errands and lying around the house, and after the first wash on a delicate cycle, inside out, cold water, hung to dry, I noticed the stitching on one of the outer seams began to unravel. I contacted Lululemon and after sending some pictures and answering some questions, I ended up returning these for store credit. I was very hesitant to re-order, but I loved the plush feel and snuggly fit of the Toasty Tech's, so I ordered another pair.
So far, fingers crossed, I have not had any unraveling, and I've probably washed them 5 times now. I recommend sizing down due to the stretching out of the material after time, but I've never had an issue with them being too baggy. These tights kept me warm on an early AM run in 25 degree weather, and I love the snug high-rise fit. They are also a great length, they are long enough to cover my ankles without a bunch of extra material bunching at the bottom. I never experienced any pilling with either pair.
Buying these is kind of a gamble on whether or not you get a good pair it seems, but Lululemon gives such great customer support and these tights are so dreamy, it was worth it to take the chance.

I have several pairs of crops/pants that I've had since 2012 and have worn many, many times (probably ~ 50 times a year since I bought them). I bought these running pants since I didn't have any tech fleece tights, so I thought they would be very useful for our cold midwest winters. I finally took the tags off last week to wear the pants while I shoveled the driveway (since temps are now at 0 degrees F). When I was done I was going to immediately text my friends to buy these pants -- they were sooo comfortable and warm! However, as I took the pants off I noticed that the seams around the crotch were UNRAVELING!! Lulu, I love your clothes, but the quality of these is terrible. This is the most I've ever spent on pants (more than I spend on jeans or dress pants), and after the FIRST wear I can no longer wear them, unless I spend more money to get them fixed! And once I get them fixed by my seamstress (who is across town and by appointment only - difficult to get in), how do I know the seams wont start unraveling in another area on the pants? As I said before, I have crops/pants from 2012 that I've worn a ton of times, and they have just now started showing wear along the seams. I can't tell you how disappointing this is. We are now in the coldest month of the year with temps regularly below 0, and I can't wear these.

These were perfect the fleece line, the pockets etc.
When trying on in the store I'm generally a size 4-6, however when I tried the 6 they were a tad on the tighter side, I was on the fence. I was advised by a worker at the store to get the 8 to be safe.
So I buy the 8 this last New Years weekend I wore them everyday (3 days off and on with my other leggings) as I was in the snow and wanted to be warm, they stretched out so much that I can tell in time the waste is going to start to slip on me and the thighs will get baggy. :-(
This is my only disappointment as now I am stuck with these $118 pair of pants that I cannot return for a smaller size. Next time I'll go with my gut and buy the smaller size would rather have too tight than big.
I've bought all new gear this year from Lulu have to say out of the approx $1,500 I've spent these so far are the only downfall, hopefully nothing else will fail me.
Otherwise they are an awesome pant and I would recommend, just please make sure to buy a snug fit.",4 out of 5,MOTOVIXEN,"SEATTLE, WA, USA",YOGI,35-44,ATHLETIC,,pockets,they stretched out too much,2016-01-08,0,0,"{'LL_response_content': ""Hey Motovixen,\nThank you for reaching out to us.

I have the bordeaux with the rose gold zippers and every time I wear them I get so many compliments. They are incredibly soft and cozy and warm! They definitely fit on the large side and are not very compressive, so if you're looking for a tighter, compressive fit, I'd say size down. I haven't worn them for running yet because of this freak warm weather but I love them for casual wear. I don't have any problems with them falling down, the rise is nice and high and the drawstring is a major plus. They are medium-warm, great for damp chilly weather, but I don't think they'd hold up to really cold temperatures as they are not wind-resistant and that's what you really need to keep out the deep cold. They're breathable for sure. My only big complaint is they are so short! I am 5'8 and there's definitely a major slice of ankle showing.

They are thick and warm and soft. I wore them under my lined dance studio pants to go to the mountains where it was below freezing and windy, and I didn't notice my legs getting even slightly chilled!
Overall, I'd rate them 5 stars if they had better pockets. I've worn them about 4-5 times already and washed them once and haven't had any pilling problems.

I absolutely love their products and how they fit and feel. I purchase items from Lulu several times a month and VERY rarely do I ever have any issues which is incredible, especially due to the sheer volume.
I bought these pants a month ago and absolutely loved them. They are incredibly warm which is great when it is 29-30 degrees outside and you want to go on a brisk walk or jog. I was debating between a 4 & 6. The staff assured me that the drawstring in the waist kept them up so I went with the size 6.
Now it has been a month, I wear them once or twice a week and they are really loose. I don't normally have this issue but because of the material they are now saggy and Unflattering. They also keep slipping which sucks if you are doing anything active. My sister had a pair on today in a size 4 and hers looked great. Fitted as they are supposed to. Mine are definitely loose and baggy which is such a bummer. I wish I had sized down to a size 4.
I am not recommending that everyone that normally wears a 6 size down on these pants but for me, I'm always in between a 4 & 6 and wish I would have gone with the 4 so that they still fit me.

I am 5'7ish and 142 lbs. I have disproportionately long legs for my height and worried based upon the reviews that they'd be too short. They expose maybe 1/2 inch of skin between the tops of my no-show socks and the bottom of the tights so it's not as bad as I expected. However, a little bit extra length would have been appreciated.
I do like the styling details of these tights, particularly the quilted panel on the side of the thighs. While my iPhone 6 in it's Speck candy shell case does fit in the side zip pocket, it sticks out in a pretty obvious way because it has to be oriented horizontally. I prefer the vertical pocket of the Speed Tights and Rebel Runner crops.

The pros:
Super soft, warm, AND breathable! They are great for just walking around in cold weather but do not get too warm during runs/bike rides. Its currently around 50F around where I live.
Super flattering
I love the pockets. Great for phones, keys, etc.
The length is perfect for me (I'm 5'5"" 115lbs and I bought the 2). I can understand that if you are taller, these pants may be a tad short.
The cons:
They pill! I've biked in them a couple of times (very short bike rides, 20min roundtrip max) and there is significant pilling around the butt. Lululemon says that pilling doesn't affect the durability of these pants but I feel like the material is thinner around the butt b/c of the pilling. If I sized up, the waist band would be falling down so I do not believe that the pilling is due to a sizing issue. I don't know if taking these pants back will help since a lot of ppl seem have problems with pilling.

STBs won't stand a chance, but these Toasties will keep you Toasty without being roasty and help you stay ready for the ride!
Thank you Lulu design team for another winning product!!!

Toasty Tech Tight II,https://shop.lululemon.com/p/women-pants/Toasty-Tech-Tight-II-MD/_/prod9270052?color=35702,3.2 out of 5,13,Great for winter running!,"I'm really excited about these pants. I've been looking for a tight that would be warm enough for the Chicago winters and I think this is it. I was a bit hesitant with the ""fleece"" in the fabric description because I thought it would be the type that would allow air to flow through or would hold moisture, but these are definitely more of a tech fabric designed for running in the winter (I probably wouldn't wear these for any indoor athletic activities). They have a quilted pattern along the outside of the thigh that I didn't notice in the pictures, but I really like it. The thicker fabric is also pretty flattering - it definitely has a smoothing effect! I thought they ran true to size and they are a full-length pant as opposed to the 7/8 pants that have been around lately (again, good for winter running!).
I bought the black and bordeaux drama. The bordeaux ended up looking a little shinier in person so I will be returning those and keeping the black. Maybe I will buy them if they end up in the WMTM section.",5 out of 5,CHICAGOBADGER,"CHICAGO, IL, USA",RUNNER,25-34,ATHLETIC,,fabric,,2015-10-16,4,1,{}
Toasty Tech Tight II,https://shop.lululemon.com/p/women-pants/Toasty-Tech-Tight-II-MD/_/prod9270052?color=35702,3.2 out of 5,13,Sooooooo SOFT!!!,"I just received these today and I can't wait until it's cold enough to to wear them. They are incredibly soft and cozy and I know I will get a lot of wear from these! I bought the Bordeau Drama colour and would buy a second pair if they weren't so expensive! They go perfect with my new Fleecy Keen Jacket in the Wine Berry colour because they both have Rose Gold zippers and diamond shaped quilting. These pants have four good sized pockets and a lot of nice details. I have very long legs with a 32"" inseam and they are more than long enough for me. Ordered my usual size for tights and they are perfect. Love EVERYTHING about them but the high price, as usual.",5 out of 5,LEELEE,"VANCOUVER, BC",YOGI,45-54,CURVY,,length,price,2015-10-15,4,0,{}
